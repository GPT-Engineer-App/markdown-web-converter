# markdown-web-converter

Write a flask app that has a text box and a submit button. When the user enters a URL into the text box the app downloads the content of the web page and creates a markdown version of a web page. Once the markdown is generated, below the submit button show a screenshot of the page on the left hand side and the markdown text on the right hand side. Make it responsive so, on smaller screens the screenshot is above the markdown text.
